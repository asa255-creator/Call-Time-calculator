NOTES:
======
- The script is flexible - it will find these patterns anywhere in your email
- You can include additional text, notes, and formatting
- Numbers can include commas (e.g., $1,250) or decimals (e.g., $1250.50)
- The patterns are case-insensitive (e.g., "Total In Soft Pledges" works too)
- If a metric is missing from an email, the script will still process other metrics
- You can include notes with asterisks (*) - the script will extract the number before the asterisk
  Example: "Total number of pledges: 3* two of these I've marked down a zero dollar pledges."
  This will extract "3"
