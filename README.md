## Setup Instructions 🛠️

### Step 1: Create a Google Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new blank spreadsheet
3. Name it something like "Call Time Reports"

### Step 2: Open Apps Script Editor

1. In your Google Sheet, click **Extensions** → **Apps Script**
2. This will open the Apps Script editor in a new tab

### Step 3: Add the Code Files

1. **Delete the default code** in `Code.gs`
2. **Copy the contents** of `Code.gs` from this repository
3. **Paste it** into the Apps Script editor

4. **Add the HTML file**:
   - Click the **+** button next to "Files"
   - Select **HTML**
   - Name it `EmailScanner` (without .html extension)
   - Copy the contents of `EmailScanner.html` from this repository
   - Paste it into the new HTML file

5. **Save the project** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
6. **Name your project** (e.g., "Call Time Calculator")

### Step 4: Initial Authorization

1. Go back to your Google Sheet and **refresh the page**
2. You should see a new menu called **"Call Time Scanner"** appear (wait a few seconds)
3. Click **Call Time Scanner** → **Scan Sent Emails**
4. The first time, you'll see an authorization dialog:
   - Click **Continue**
   - Select your Google account
   - Click **Advanced** → **Go to [Your Project Name] (unsafe)**
   - Click **Allow**

This authorization is needed so the script can read your Gmail sent folder.

### Understanding the Results

The script will create a formatted report showing:

**Search Parameters**
- Email address searched
- Date range
- Number of emails found

**Totals**
- Total Session Hours
- Total Soft Pledges
- Total Hard Pledges
- Total Estimated Pledges
- Total Number of Pledges
- Total Number of Calls
- Total Number of Pickups

**Calculated Metrics**
- Pickup Rate (percentage)
- Average Pledge Amount
- Calls Per Hour

### Clearing Results

To clear the current results:
1. Click **Call Time Scanner** → **Clear Results**

## Email Format Requirements 📧

Your emails should contain lines with these patterns:

```
Session length: 2 hours (2hrs)
Total in soft pledges: $250
Total in hard pledges: $0
Total estimated pledges: $250
Total number of pledges: 3
Number of calls: 20
Number of pickups: 4
```

The script is flexible and will find these patterns even if there's other text around them.

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### "Call Time Scanner" menu doesn't appear
- Try refreshing your Google Sheet
- Make sure you saved the Apps Script project
- Wait up to 30 seconds after opening the sheet

### "Authorization required" errors
- Follow the authorization steps in Step 4 above
- Make sure you're using the same Google account for both Sheets and Gmail

### No emails found
- Check that the email address is correct
- Try a longer date range
- Verify that you sent emails to that address from your Gmail account
- Make sure your emails contain the required format

### Missing metrics in results
- Check that your emails follow the format requirements
- The script looks for specific patterns (case-insensitive)
- Even if some metrics are missing from some emails, the script will still process available data

## Privacy & Security 🔒

- This script only runs in your Google account
- It only reads emails from your **sent folder**
- No data is sent to external servers
- All processing happens within Google's infrastructure
- You can review the code to see exactly what it does

## Customization 🎨

You can customize the script by editing `Code.gs`:

- **Add more date ranges**: Edit the dropdown options in `EmailScanner.html`
- **Change the output format**: Modify the `displayResults()` function
- **Add more metrics**: Update the `parseEmailMetrics()` function with new patterns
- **Export to CSV**: Add a new menu item with an export function
